### 🚀 How It Works

1. **Leaflet & Folium Integration**  
   The maps are built using **[Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)** for rendering the map interface and **[Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)** for creating Python-generated maps with rich features.
   
2. **Real-time Data**  
   All maps dynamically update based on the latest data sources, ensuring that the visualizations are current and relevant.

3. **Custom Visualizations**  
   Maps come with a range of visualizations like **choropleth layers**, **point markers**, and **polylines** to represent different datasets.
